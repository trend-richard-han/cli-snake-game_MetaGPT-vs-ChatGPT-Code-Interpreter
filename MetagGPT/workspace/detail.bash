## Original Requirements
The boss has asked for the creation of a command-line interface (CLI) snake game.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a simple, fun and engaging CLI snake game",
    "Ensure the game is easy to navigate and user-friendly",
    "Implement a scoring system to track player progress"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to be able to easily start a new game so that I can play whenever I want",
    "As a user, I want clear instructions on how to play the game so that I can understand the rules",
    "As a user, I want to be able to control the snake using my keyboard so that I can play the game",
    "As a user, I want the game to become progressively more difficult so that I am continuously challenged",
    "As a user, I want to see my score so that I can track my progress"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Python Snake Game: A simple CLI snake game with basic functionality",
    "JavaScript Snake Game: A web-based snake game with a more visual interface",
    "Retro Snake Game: A mobile app that replicates the classic snake game on old mobile phones",
    "Slither.io: A multiplayer online game where players control a snake and try to grow by eating orbs",
    "Snake '97: A mobile app that replicates the classic snake game with a retro interface",
    "Snake VS Block: A mobile game that combines the snake game with a block-breaking mechanic",
    "Google Snake Game: A web-based snake game offered by Google as part of its doodle games"
]
```

    "Retro Snake Game": [0.4, 0.3]
    "Slither.io": [0.8, 0.7]

    "Snake VS Block": [0.7, 0.6]
    "Google Snake Game": [0.9, 0.8]
    "Our Target Product": [0.5, 0.6]
```

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a CLI snake game that is easy to navigate and user-friendly. It should include a scoring system to track player progress. The game should become progressively more difficult as the player's score increases.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ("Implement a CLI for the game", "P0"),
    ("Create a snake that the player can control", "P0"),
    ("Implement a scoring system", "P0"),
    ("Increase game difficulty as the player's score increases", "P1"),
    ("Provide clear instructions on how to play the game", "P1")
]
```

## UI Design draft
The game will be based on a CLI, so the design will be text-based. The snake will be represented by a series of characters that move around the screen. The player's score will be displayed at the top of the screen. The game will have a simple, clean design to make it easy for the player to focus on the gameplay.

## Anything UNCLEAR
There are no unclear points.

## Implementation approach
The game will be implemented using Python's built-in libraries such as curses for the CLI interface and random for the food generation. The game will have a main loop that will keep the game running until the player loses. The snake will be a list of coordinates that will move in a certain direction based on the player's input. The food will be a randomly generated coordinate that the snake can eat to increase its length. The score will be calculated based on the length of the snake. The difficulty will increase by decreasing the delay between each move of the snake as the score increases.

## Python package name
```python
"cli_snake_game"
```

## File list
```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "scoreboard.py"
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions

        +start_game()

    }
    class ScoreBoard{

        +update_score()
    }
    Game "1" -- "1" Snake: controls
    Game "1" -- "1" Food: controls
    Game "1" -- "1" ScoreBoard: updates

            G->>SB: update_score()
        end
    end
    G->>M: end_game()
```

## Logic Analysis

    ("game.py", "Contains the Game class. It should control the game flow, including starting and ending the game, controlling the snake and food, and updating the scoreboard."),
    ("snake.py", "Contains the Snake class. It should handle the movement, growth, and collision checking of the snake."),
    ("food.py", "Contains the Food class. It should handle the generation of food coordinates."),
    ("scoreboard.py", "Contains the ScoreBoard class. It should handle the updating of the score.")
]

## Task list
```python
[
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "scoreboard.py",
    "game.py",

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'curses' library is used for creating the CLI interface of the game.
The 'random' library is used for generating the food coordinates.
The game flow is controlled by the Game class in 'game.py'.
The Snake class in 'snake.py' handles the movement, growth, and collision checking of the snake.
The Food class in 'food.py' handles the generation of food coordinates.
The ScoreBoard class in 'scoreboard.py' handles the updating of the score.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear. However, we need to ensure that the team is familiar with the 'curses' library for creating the CLI interface. Also, we need to decide on the scoring system, i.e., how much score to increase when the snake eats food.

In this code, the `Food` class is defined with methods to generate a new food coordinate and update the display of the food. The `generate` method generates a random coordinate within the window, ensuring that the coordinate is not within the snake's body. The `update` method updates the display of the food at its current coordinate.
